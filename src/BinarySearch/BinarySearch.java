    It is a type of Binary Tree in which data is organized in an ordered manner which 
    helps in faster search and insertion of data . It satisfies following properties -
    
    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values lesser than the node's value.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
    The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

    null <---- left  |  data  |  right ---> null
