    There are several different algorithms to solve a given problem.
    Analysis of algorithm deals in finding best algorithm which runs fast and take in less memory.
    For example-
    Q.find sum of first n natural numbers.
        a)input :- n=4
       Output:-10 i.e(1+2+3+4)
       b)input:-n=5
