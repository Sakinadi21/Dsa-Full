    It's a non-linear data structure used for storing data
    It is made up of nodes and edges without having any cycle
    Each node in a tree can point to n number of nodes in a tree
    It is a way of representing hierarchical structure with a parent node called as
     root and many levels of additional nodes.

      root ->  1
             /   \

                  TreeNode



     public class TreeNode{
      private int data ; //Generic type
      private TreeNode left;
      private TreeNode right;

      public TreeNode(int data){
         this.data = data;
         }
      }
