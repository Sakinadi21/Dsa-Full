    In selection sort we divide the given array into two parts - sorted part
    and unsorted part.
    The algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum in an unsorted array
    and making it part of the sorted array.
    From unsorted part,we pick minimum element and swap it with leftmost element of unsorted
    part. After swap, the element now becomes part of sorted array.
    It's repeated till unsorted array is not empty.
