    Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way
    we sort playing cards in our hands.
    In insertion sort we divide the given array into two parts -
    sorted part and unsorted part.
    From unsorted part, we take first element and place at its
    correct position in sorted array . This is done by shifting all the
    elements which are larger than first element by one position.
    It's repeated till unsorted array in empty.
